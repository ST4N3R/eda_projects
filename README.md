## About <a name = "about"></a>

I wanted to learn how to make impactful reports and analyses, what is the best way to present results and how to dive into data more. I created three analyses, everyone is on different topics - data science salaries, football top 5 leagues and IMDB movies. You can check all of them! I used few python libraries - pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly and interpret.

## Football top 5 leagues <a name = "exptected_goals"></a>

This project took me the longest, beacuese I tried to find few interesing insight in this data. I tries to analyse each league and find which one is the most enterteining, which one is the hardest to win and which one is the most competetive. I also dived more into teams results and I tried to find which one is the luckiest and unluckiest in front of the goal, which one is the most luckiest and luckiest to finish in this position in the table, I tried to find the best defensive and the best offensive teams. I had a lot fun create this analysis, becuase I am the fan of the football myself :).
